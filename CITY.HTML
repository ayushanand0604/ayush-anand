<hr><br> <h3 align="center">* Tapas Pal died due to Centre's political vendetta, harassment by CBI, Mamata Banerjee blames BJP</h3></hr>
<br><a href="https://ibb.co/bXKTB4Z"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/2dkxtzQ/tapas-pal-mamata-ians-770x433.png" alt="tapas-pal-mamata-ians-770x433" height="240px" width="144px" class="center"></a>
<article><br>A day after former Trinamool Congress MP and popular Bengali actor Tapas Pal died of cardiac arrest, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee hit out at the Centre saying pressure from central investigating agencies are to be blamed for his untimely death.

<br><p>Mamata Banerjee said on Wednesday, "Central government's pressure has claimed so many lives. Three people died due to this pressure by the agencies. First former TMP MP Sultan Ahmed then TMC MP Prasun Banerjee's wife passed away and now Tapas Pal."

She said that all these deaths are to be blamed on the Centre and its politics of vendetta.</p>

<p>Tapas Pal died after suffering a cardiac arrest at a Mumbai hospital early on Tuesday. He was 61.

Tapas Pal's sudden death triggered a blame game between the Trinamool Congress and BJP as the TMC held the Centre guilty of "mentally torturing" him and pursuing "political vendetta" against him. BJP, however, rejected the charge as "baseless", which said Tapas Pal paid for the "sins" of his party who used him as a scapegoat.</p>

<p>The two-time former Lok Sabha MP from West Bengal's Krishnanagar had a long history of heart and neurological problems, and had been in and out of hospitals during the past two years.

Tapas Pal drifted away from both cinema and active politics after he was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and jailed in connection with the Rose Valley chit-fund scam case in December 2016.

Mamata Banerjee has said, "People are being jailed but central agencies while they have not even been able to prove any involvement or conclude what crime these people committed. If someone commits a crime, they must face action. But we still don't know what crime Tapas Pal and others committed."</p>
